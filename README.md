# Cards Against Humanity, Standalone Flask-Based Web-App:
Cards Against Humanity (abbreviated as CAH) is a fun, creative commons-licensed card game in which players complete "fill-in-the-blank" statements yusing words or phrases rich are typically, offensive, risqu√© or politically incorrect.

I aim to take this fun and enriching cardgame and convert it into a python based web-app which utilises Python, SQL, CSS and HTML, and demonstrates my skills and foresight in devops, project management, HCI and containerisation.

This repository is also part of the deliverables for the QA devops project 2. and thus, will aim to split the application across 4, deployable "Docker" containers from a script.
